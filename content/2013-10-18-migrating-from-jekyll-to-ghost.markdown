Yesterday I decided to make the move from [Jekyll][1] to the new blogging platform [Ghost][0]. I was interested in the project since [the kickstarter campaign][3], but I didn't join the founders then.

After releasing *Ghost* to the public I downloaded the published version and ran it on my local machine. *Ghost* is based on [Nodejs][4], which I'm already familiar, so using [npm][5] and [forever][6] to run it was not much of a problem. After playing around with the admin interface for a bit I decided to research ways to migrate from *Jekyll* to *Ghost*.

Both blog platforms are using [Markdown][7] when you edit posts, so I figured it wouldn't be too hard to convert the files. Unfortunately, *Ghost* is quite silent when it comes to documentation about their APIs or the import/export formats. I tried to come up with my own nodejs module to import files, but quickly discovered the great *Jekyll* plugin [Jekyll-To-Ghost][2].

All you have to do is

* copy the plugin file into your *_plugins* folder
* make sure that your *_config.yml* includes *safe: false* (to enable plugins)
* run *jekyll build*

After your site is generated, you have a file *_site/ghost-exported.json* with all your posts in an acceptable JSON format which you can import into your installation of *Ghost* via http://yourdomain:2368/ghost/debug/.

I forked and modified the plugin a bit to convert links generated by the tag *post_url* into hard relative links (*Ghost* doesn't support custom URL formats yet) and fixed the conversion of timestamps which was broken for me.

After importing all my posts I decided to run my own theme, so I copied the default theme *casper* and made some changes to it. Next would be to modify the theme and add [Disqus][8] for comments. I'm curious how the migration for the comments goes along, because I have to modify the identifiers in *Disqus* to use the new URL structure too.
