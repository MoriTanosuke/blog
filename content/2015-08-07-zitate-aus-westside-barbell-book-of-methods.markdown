Hier kommen ein paar Zitate aus dem Buch "[Westside Barbell Book of Methods][0]":

**Weight gain or loss**

> As far as food intake, skip the chocolate milk and cookies and learn about 
> proper nutrition. Buy a book or two and read and learn.

**Raising work capacity and general fitness**

> To think that one must fully rest between sets is old thinking to say the least. If you do a work task 
> and fully recover and then repeat the same work, you will use the very same muscle fi ber. You 
> gain nothing by training this way. But, by enlisting shorter and shorter rest intervals between 
> work sets (i.e. the interval method), the work will be far more intense involving more muscle 
> fiber. You will find that the last half of your speed sets will be more explosive of all. When lactic 
> acid is produced, so is the growth hormone. If you have a high work capacity, a high volume, 
> high intensity workout is not as tiring for you as it would be for someone out of shape. This 
> enables you to train a little heavier and longer and a little faster than your enemies.
>
> ...
>
> But whatever exercise you do, it should slowly increase in intensity and volume
> as the years pass. Ease into the work but always aim to increase the amount of work. The better 
> condition youâ€™re in, the faster your new records will come. There is much to learn if you are to 
> succeed, and it takes time. You must gain mentally, technically, and physically. So be patient.
