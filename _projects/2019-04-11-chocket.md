I started this project on 29. July 2012, mostly to learn more [node][2] and
have a first look at [socket.io][3]. It was also briefly used as a simple way
to stay in contact with colleagues working in another country.

It is a pretty basic Node application which is not structured very well, but it
does support the browser [Notification API][4] and it works good enough.
I deployed it to [Heroku][5] and I also added a *Deploy to Heroku* button in
the README so you can have your own instance.
