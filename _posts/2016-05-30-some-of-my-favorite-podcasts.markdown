title: "Some of my favorite podcasts"

I'm listening to podcasts regularly. In the last couple of weeks I stumbled upon some very interesting and entertaining episodes on different podcasts. If you're interested in people and their stories, try to listen to them:

* [The Nerdist - Jodie Foster][0]
* [The Nerdist - Josh Brolin][1]
* [Tim Ferriss - Jamie Fox][2]
* [Tim Ferriss - Christopher Sommer][3]
* [Tim Ferriss - Shaun White][4]

I don't listen to all of the episodes on those podcasts, but Tim Ferriss usually has very interesting people on his show and a wide variety of topics.
