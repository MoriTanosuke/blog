title: "Glacieruploader command-line tool is available via maven central"
---
A couple of days ago I decided to [upload my command-line client][0] for *Amazon Glacier* to [Maven central][1]. I had to do some preparation and clean up, but as of today the modules and the client itself is available at [https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22de.kopis.glacier%22][2].

If you just want the client, go ahead and download the *glacieruploader-impl* using the *jar-with-dependencies* from [https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22glacieruploader-impl%22][3].

For all the other modules I'll add more documentation in the upcoming days.
