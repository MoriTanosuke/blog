title: 'Preparations for #Jbcnconf'
---
[Jbcnconf][0] is coming close. I think I'm good with my preparations:

* Flight, Hotel, Aerobus booked
* Tickets printed (and stored to all kind of devices: laptop, phone, usb sticks, ...)
* Laptop prepared (I am setting up a workspace to hack on *Apache Camel* while I'm on the road, and I am just starting up my [fabric8 environment][1] to play with my [Docker][2] containers)

I'm also syncing my important files to all my devices with [BitTorrent Sync][3]. I will also backup my stuff to my Drobo and some USB sticks for offsite backup. When I'm back I have to review my setup, because I'm not quite sure if I have some of my (encrypted) files on unencrypted media. I usually put everything in Truecrypt containers when I'm on the road, but maybe some of the files leaked onto insecure media... And Truecrypt, well, that's a whole different story. I want to be prepared for the next crypto wars, but I guess one day before starting a trip is not the right time to switch your backup and crypto setup.

Anyway, I'm looking forward to the conference and the talks. Maybe I'll get the chance to do some small talk with developers of the frameworks I use and have a nice time in Barcelona. :smile:
