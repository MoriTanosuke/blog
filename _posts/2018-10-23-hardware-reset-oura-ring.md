On the weekend my [Oura ring][0] didn't connect to the app anymore when I wanted to see my [HRV][1] in the morning. I tried the [troubleshooting steps from the FAQs][2] but without any change, so I wondered how to actually reset the ring. There is no UI, no buttons, no reachable connectors at all.

The support helped me out, and here is a short description of the hardware reset procedure for the [Oura ring][0]:

* Place the ring on the (powered) charger. Make sure the charging LED is glowing.
* Hold the ring in place with your finger.
* Tap the charger + ring on the table a couple times.
* Wait a minute.
* Check if the ring is showing up in your app again.

Hope this helps.
