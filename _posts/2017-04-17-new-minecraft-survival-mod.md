title: "New minecraft survival mod for 1.11.2"
---
Because I'm playing on a new *[Minecraft][3] 1.11.2* world at the moment, I thought it
would be nice to have a simple mod to add a few recipes, for example smelting
rotten flesh into leather or craft a few things that are usually not craftable.
I don't want to go overboard with recipes and custom blocks or items, so the mod
will only get a few recipes to improve on the vanilla survival feeling.

So I decided to write a new mod: [Survival Recipes][0]. It's [available on Curse][1]
and you can add it to your 1.11.x profiles. The [sourcecode is on Github][2], so 
feel free to create issues or do a pull request with new recipes.
