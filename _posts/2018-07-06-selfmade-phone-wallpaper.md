A couple weeks ago I took some photos with my [A7ii][0] and one of them turned out good enough so it's now my phone wallpaper:

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/cringe/41388764754/in/datetaken/" title="lMsIXw2"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/978/41388764754_34b25c238b_b.jpg" width="747" height="1024" alt="lMsIXw2"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

You can also see it [on Flickr][1].
