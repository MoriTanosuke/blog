title: "Learning Erlang"
---
It's time again to dip my toes into a new programming language. This time I chose [Erlang][0]. Why, I don't know. But if you want to give it a try, here's what I did to get started:

* Run erlang in a docker container for quick setup: `docker run --rm -it erlang` - now you have an erlang shell open and you can start typing
* Go read [http://learnyousomeerlang.com/content][1]

I'm still very early into the language, but I already find similar patterns to [Clojure][2] (which I'm also never used in production). So if you are familiar with some [LISP][3], you'll feel at home quickly.
