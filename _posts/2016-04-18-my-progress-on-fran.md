Yesterday I did the [Crossfit Workout "Fran"][0] again.

**"Fran"**

Three rounds, 21-15- and 9 reps, for time of:

* 95-pound Thruster (42,5kg)
* Pull-ups

This workout is one of the most iconic workouts of Crossfit and every crossfitter knows his *"fran time"*. My best is 08:06. Yesterday I did it it 08:09, which I consider a good time considering that I sat around on my desk all time and was working out almost 2 hours later as usual.

I'm sure I've done *Fran* before 13.02.2015, but I don't have that data in [Beyond The Whiteboard][1]. IIRC the first time was scaled, probably to 20kg or 30kg and it took me almost 20 minutes. The 2 last workouts feel more like my limit, because I really suck at [Thrusters][2]. ðŸ˜ž

Anyway, I really feel good with a Fran time of roughly 8 minutes. It's not very fast, but it's not horribly slow either.
