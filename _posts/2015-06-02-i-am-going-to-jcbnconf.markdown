I'm going to [#jbcnconf in Barcelona][0] on 26 - 27 June. The [list of speakers][1] include some of the very public names of some of the large open source frameworks I use a lot:

*Claus Ibsen* will talk about ["Microservices with Apache Camel"][3]. *Jean Baptiste Onofre* will talk about ["Apache Karaf for the Enterprise"][2]. *James Strachan* will be there, talking about ["Kubernetes for Java Developers"][4].

Sounds like fun, so I hope the ticket confirmation is arriving soon so I can book the flight and hotel. :-)ï»¿
