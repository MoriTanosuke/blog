Ok, the cat is out of the bag: the [CrossFit Games are changing][0]:

> CrossFit-sanctioned competitions are replacing CrossFit's Regional 
> events and will become a direct pathway for the top men, women and 
> team competitors to receive invitations to compete at the CrossFit 
> Games. The Dubai CrossFit Championship is the first sanctioned 
> event to be announced. CrossFit anticipates that additional 
> sanctioned events will be announced in the coming months.

This basically confirms half of the [previous rumors][1], *Regionals* are no more. There is no word on *the Open*, or the time schedule for the Games qualification overall.

My points from the last article still stands: Nothing changes for 99% of the crossfitters out there. If you participated in the *Open* before, you probably will do so again - even if you're not expecting to go to *Regionals* or the Games or any other competition. The *Open* basically is an event for the Boxes, now even more so than before.

If you're a games athlete, it's a completely different topic. I think [Jacob Heppner talks about good points in one of his videos][2]: Will there be an *off-season* for the athletes? Probably not when they really want to qualify and have to do multiple of the qualification competitions. And now it's a competition where you have only one shot, just like *Regionals* - with the advantage that you can maybe qualify for multiple of them and not just one.

We'll see how this will work out and how the athletes will spread out over the competitions. But for the average crossfitter, all of this doesn't really change anything.
