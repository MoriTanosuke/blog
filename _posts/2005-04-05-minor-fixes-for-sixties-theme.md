Today I cleared the image issue. When you post a smiley or an image without enough text to float around, the image breaks out of the article box. This is cleared now, I don't use floating images as default. You have to give the `img` tag a `class="alignright"`, `class="alignleft"` or `class="centered"` option, to float the image around.
