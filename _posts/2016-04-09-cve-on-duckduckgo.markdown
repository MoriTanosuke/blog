title: 'CVE Information on DuckDuckGo'
layout: post
---
A couple of days ago I was searching for informationen on a specific *Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)*. I am using [DuckDuckGo][2] as my search engine of choice and they provide a lot of information right on the search page in so called [Instant Answers][3] and I was a bit baffled that no information for my CVE showed up right away.

As a software developer, my spontanous reaction was to create a [new instant answer to display CVE information][0].

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/cringe/25715574934/in/dateposted/" title="CVE information as Instant Answer on DuckDuckGo search engine"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1477/25715574934_1538ca9874_n.jpg" width="320" height="213" alt="CVE information as Instant Answer on DuckDuckGo search engine"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

You can already [use the instant answer on the Beta server][1]. I hope the PR gets merged soon so all users of [DuckDuckGo][2] can get information about CVEs quickly.

The development process itself is pretty straight forward:

* Fork the [zeroclickinfo-spice repository][4]
* Set up your development environment in your browser using [codio][5]
* Hack some python and javascript
* Run the duckduckgo server on codio and test your code
