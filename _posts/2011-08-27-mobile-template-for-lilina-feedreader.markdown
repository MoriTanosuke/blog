title: Mobile template for Lilina RSS feedreader
---
**Update:** In the meantime [I forked Lilina on github][6]. You can get the files for my mobile template from there.

Yesterday I installed [Lilina][1] on my quest for a replacement of [Google Reader][2] and I missed a nice way to read my feeds from my mobile device. Unfortunatly there is nothing like [the android app for *tiny tiny rss*][3], so I decided to build a nicer template made for mobile devices.

This is my first shot:

If you want to have a look at my installation, head over to [my self-hosted homepage][4].

Unfortunatly I have a problem with the templating system. I have yet to figure out how to solve my issue, because the [IUI framework][5] I use to generate nice *iphony* screens needs the HTML markup in a very specific way and I'm not able to generate it that way at the moment. But I think that's only a minor problem and I hope to solve it soon.
