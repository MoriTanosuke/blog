If you want to start programming and you ask me for advice, you'll probably hear me recommending [Java][0] over other programming languages. That's partly because I'm developing software in Java for about 10 years now, but it's also because I think Java is a good language to [learn the basics of software][2] and to get a grip on how to use [Frameworks][1] other people wrote - a major basis for everyday work you'll do if you are a programmer of any sort. Java will also teach you about [classes, objects and interfaces][3] - the hard way. Meaning that you'll most likely be confused about the differences between *interfaces*, *abstract classes* and *final classes* for some time.

So, where exactly do you start to learn Java?

Let's make some assumptions first:

* You have little to no programming background.
* You don't want to learn about the inner workings of your hardware, but you want to write software.
* You are single-minded and very, very patient.

Ok, with that out of the way, let's start with getting everything you need to write your first Java application.

* [Download Eclipse][4], an [IDE][5] where you'll write your Java code
* [Download the latest JDK][6] - make sure you get the *JDK*, not the *JRE*
* Start *Eclipse* and create a new Java project.
